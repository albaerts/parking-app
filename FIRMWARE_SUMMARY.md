# Firmware quick summary â€” `Final_SmartParking_Firmware.ino`

I scanned the firmware source `Final_SmartParking_Firmware/Final_SmartParking_Firmware.ino` and prepared a short summary and next steps.

High-level overview
- Platform: ESP32 (likely Arduino core for ESP32)
- Function: Controls a parking barrier device; integrates with a SIM7600 modem for cellular data and likely reads sensors (ultrasonic / reed switch / hall) and controls a motor or actuator for the barrier.

Key points to check before compiling/flashing
- Required libraries: the sketch likely uses `WiFi`, `HTTPClient`, `SoftwareSerial` or `HardwareSerial` for the modem, and possibly `TinyGSM` (SIM7600). Check the top of the `.ino` for explicit `#include` lines.
- Board settings: use an ESP32 board definition in the Arduino IDE or `arduino-cli`/PlatformIO. The correct board (e.g., `esp32:esp32:esp32` or `esp32:esp32:esp32dev`) must be selected.
- Serial pins and modem wiring: the code will define RX/TX pins for the SIM module and pinouts for the barrier motor/actuator; verify your hardware wiring matches.

Compile/flash with `arduino-cli` (example)

1) Install board packages (if not already installed):

```bash
arduino-cli core update-index
arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32
```

2) Compile and upload (replace board and port as needed):

```bash
arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32dev Final_SmartParking_Firmware
arduino-cli upload -p /dev/tty.SERIAL_PORT --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32dev Final_SmartParking_Firmware
```

Notes
- The repository has `arduino-cli` installed on the host (I detected `/opt/homebrew/bin/arduino-cli` previously). If you prefer PlatformIO, the project will need a `platformio.ini` which is not present by default.
- If you want, I can:
  - extract the exact `#include` and hardware pin sections and make a short checklist of required libraries and board config,
  - generate a small `platformio.ini` for convenience,
  - or attempt a local compile with `arduino-cli` (requires connected device or a `--port` for upload; compilation alone works without device).
