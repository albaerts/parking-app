Conversation Export – Smart Parking Project (Albert Gashi)
Date: 2025-10-13

Overview
This file summarizes the collaboration: goals, decisions, code/docs changes, hardware choices, and remaining follow-ups in plain text.

Timeline (high-level)
1) App start (backend + frontend)
- Request: “ok. starte die app bitte”
- Result: Python venv, FastAPI (uvicorn) backend health OK; React frontend deps installed, dev server attempted.

2) Login mismatch fixed
- Issue: Frontend expected PHP endpoints, got 404.
- Action: Added dev shims /login.php and /register.php. Added stubs for /parking-sessions.

3) Hardware deliverables
- Provided wiring guide and test sketches (servo and hall). Added a WiFi all‑in‑one firmware.

4) Cellular path preferred
- Delivered SIM7600 all‑in‑one sketch (TinyGSM), Swisscom APN, HTTPS (insecure test), health pings.

5) Public tunneling
- localtunnel flaky → switched to cloudflared Quick Tunnel. trycloudflare URL wired into the SIM sketch.

6) SIM7600 HAT clarification
- HAT (B) is USB‑only; recommended HAT (A) with UART. Provided precise wiring (ESP32 ↔ SIM7600A, Servo, Hall), power best practices.

7) Power supply guidance
- Clarified 5 V regulator choice (Pololu S13V20F5). Introduced optional bulk capacitors (Elkos) to handle current spikes.

8) Shopping lists and diagrams
- Created A4 wiring SVG + Markdown wrapper. Extended shopping list with optional capacitors and added two energy variants:
  - Variant B: 2×18650 + 5 V regulator
  - Variant A: Powerbank + PD trigger

9) Finalizing Variant A
- Added detailed Variant A (Powerbank + PD trigger) with CH search links. Added WAGO 221 concrete parts block.

Key Decisions
- Use FastAPI backend with dev shims to match frontend.
- Prefer cloudflared Quick Tunnel for public access.
- Use SIM7600 HAT A (UART) with ESP32; servo SG92R/SG90; hall A3144.
- Power via Powerbank + PD‑Trigger (Variant A) for simplicity; 2×18650 variant documented as alternative.
- Bulk caps optional: 1000 µF @ HAT, 330–470 µF @ servo, 100 nF ceramics in parallel.

Files created/edited
- backend/server_gashis.py (added dev auth endpoints and session stubs)
- hardware/smart_parking_all_in_one.ino (WiFi)
- hardware/smart_parking_sim7600_all_in_one.ino (SIM7600 + HTTPS + APN + health)
- hardware/WIRING_ESP32_SIM7600A_A4.svg (A4 wiring diagram)
- hardware/WIRING_ESP32_SIM7600A_A4.md (legend + print hints)
- SMART_PARKING_EINKAUFSLISTE.md (optional capacitors)
- DIGITEC_BESTELLHILFE_ZUERICH.md
  - Added ARTIKEL 9 (Variante B 2×18650)
  - Added ARTIKEL 10 (Variante A Powerbank)
  - Added WAGO 221 concrete recommendation block

Tunneling and endpoints
- Backend: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Public: cloudflared Quick Tunnel (trycloudflare.com URL)
- Endpoints: /health, /login.php, /register.php, /parking-spots, /parking-sessions (stub)

Firmware notes
- ESP32 pins: Servo GPIO18, Hall GPIO19, LED GPIO2. SIM7600 UART on GPIO16/17.
- TinyGsmClientSecure setInsecure for quick HTTPS tests.
- SERVER_HOST to be updated to current trycloudflare domain.

Wiring highlights
- Shared 5 V bus via WAGO 221‑415 for +5 V and GND.
- Star topology: PD‑Trigger → WAGO → HAT/Servo/ESP32.
- Optional: DC 5.5×2.1 screw plug for a detachable output.

Open follow-ups
- Update SIM sketch SERVER_HOST to the active trycloudflare URL; ensure APN gprs.swisscom.ch, USE_HTTPS=1.
- Short end‑to‑end test doc: flash, health 200, hall trigger → POST 200 → UI update.

Quick test checklist (proposed)
- Start backend (uvicorn) → /health OK.
- Start cloudflared Quick Tunnel → copy public URL.
- Flash ESP32 SIM sketch with SERVER_HOST set.
- Serial monitor: wait for network, expect “health 200”.
- Trigger hall sensor → observe POST on server logs, UI reflects status.
